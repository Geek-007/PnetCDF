This is essentially a placeholder for the next release note ...
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  o New features
    * The configure environment has been migrated to use automake.
    * Building shared libraries is now supported with configure option
      --enable-shared. The default is building static library only. Note linking
      shared libraries is not recommended due to the likely performance
      degradation.

  o New Limitation
    * The maximum number of files that can be simultaneously opened by an MPI
      process is 1024 (a constant NC_MAX_NFILES defined in pnetcdf.h).

  o New APIs
    * none

  o New optimization
    * none

  o Syntax changes
    * none

  o Semantics updates
    * When the file create/open modes are not consistent among processes, the
      modes will be replaced by rank 0's mode and PnetCDF library will still
      try to create/open the file. Error code NC_EMULTIDEFINE_CMODE or
      NC_EMULTIDEFINE_OMODE will be returned on processes whose modes disagree
      with rank 0's. If safe mode is on, then rank 0 will also get the error
      code.

  o New utility program
    * none

  o New error code precedence
    * none

  o New error code
    * none

  o New PnetCDF hint
    * none

  o New run-time environment variables
    * none

  o New example programs
    * none

  o New programs for I/O benchmarks
    * none

  o New test program
    * none

  o Other updates:
    * Rename pkg-config file from pnetcdf.pc to libpnetcdf.pc
    * Configure time variables TEST_SEQRUN, TEST_MPIRUN, and TEST_OUTDIR are
      renamed to TESTSEQRUN, TESTMPIRUN, and TESTOUTDIR, respectively, to
      avoid the variable name convention used by automake.

  o Bug fixes
    * none

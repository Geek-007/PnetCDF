This is essentially a placeholder for the next release note ...
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

  o New features
    * The configure environment has been migrated to use automake.
    * Building shared libraries is now supported with configure option
      --enable-shared. The default is building static library only. Note linking
      shared libraries is not recommended due to the likely performance
      degradation.

  o New Limitation
    * The maximum number of files that can be simultaneously opened by an MPI
      process is 1024 (a constant NC_MAX_NFILES defined in pnetcdf.h).

  o New APIs
    * none

  o New optimization
    * none

  o Syntax changes
    * none

  o Semantics updates
    * When the file create/open modes are not consistent among processes, the
      modes will be replaced by rank 0's mode and PnetCDF library will still
      try to create/open the file. Error code NC_EMULTIDEFINE_CMODE or
      NC_EMULTIDEFINE_OMODE will be returned on processes whose modes disagree
      with rank 0's. If safe mode is on, then rank 0 will also get the error
      code.

  o New utility program
    * none

  o New error code precedence
    * none

  o New error code
    * none

  o New PnetCDF hint
    * none

  o New run-time environment variables
    * none

  o New example programs
    * none

  o New programs for I/O benchmarks
    * none

  o New test program
    * test/testcases/null_args.c - tests whether the correct error codes can
      be returned when using NULL arguments for start, count, stride, or imap

  o Other updates:
    * Rename pkg-config file from pnetcdf.pc to libpnetcdf.pc
    * Configure time variables TEST_SEQRUN, TEST_MPIRUN, and TEST_OUTDIR are
      renamed to TESTSEQRUN, TESTMPIRUN, and TESTOUTDIR, respectively, to
      avoid the variable name convention used by automake.

  o Bug fixes
    * Fix nc_test when running on an ARMv7 architecture, a raspberry pi, where
      char is unsigned and is little Endian, 32-bit machine. See r2922.
    * Fix the missing byte-swap required for retrieving user-defined fill
      values. See r2864. This fix is critical when PnetCDF is configured with
      option erange-fill enabled (default mode) and the target platform is a
      Little Endian.
    * Fix test program test/nc_test/test_read.m4 and test/testcases/modes.c for
      testing whether the correct error codes can be returned when opening a
      non-existing file. Thanks to Mark Dixon for testing various MPI
      implementations, compilers, and file systems, we found that when using
      MVAPICH2 2.2, its Lustre driver always adds O_CREAT flag to the open()
      calls. Because of this behavior, the non-existing file will be created
      with zero length, which causes PnetCDF to spew NC_ENOTNC instead of
      NC_ENOENT. A bug report has been filed to MVAPICH. The fix shall come in
      the next release of MVAPICH. The bug report can be found in
      http://mailman.cse.ohio-state.edu/pipermail/mvapich-discuss/2017-February/006300.html
